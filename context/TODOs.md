- Define a simple solution from scratch for implementing multiple brands in Angular (this is so I understand the typical approach)
    Additional Requirements:
        - CSS changes using Angular Material
        - Text from BFF
        - Images from BFF
        - Optional, how to change the routing from one brand to another?
- Create a chart in mermaid showing the moving pieces and how they integrate together.
- Discuss the solution in detail and clarify any uncertainties/questions, update the chart.
- Here are some questions:
    - How would Server Side Rendering vs Static website affect the design?
    - Do design patterns such as ngrx (flux) affect the design from the angular side?
    - What about Signals vs RxJs?
- Once we have a clear understanding of the generic solution, we'll create a new design document with new mermaid diagrams as needed and finalize the solution.
- Then discuss how How hard it will be to mock the solution up? I'd prefer this to be on my local unless it is relatively easy to implement in AWS.
    - Quick and dirty BFF server.
 
- How would the merge be performed? What sequence of events?
