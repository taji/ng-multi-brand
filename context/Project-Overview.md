# Angular Multi-Brand Application Merger - System Design

## Project Overview
Merge two separate Angular applications (different codebases, different brands) into a single unified application that uses a content management system to deliver brand-specific experiences.

## Current State Analysis

### Technical Stack
- **Frontend:** Angular 17
- **Styling:** Plain CSS (considering migration to SCSS)
- **Deployment:** Jenkins, 2-week cycles, trunk-based development
- **Feature Flags:** Launch Darkly (existing)
- **Infrastructure:** AWS
- **Domains:** Two separate domains for each brand

### Key Constraints
- Different routing structures and component hierarchies
- Some shared backend services
- Possible shared libraries (TBD)
- Performance requirement: Page load < 1 second
- Weekly brand content updates required
- Real-time content updates preferred

## Recommended Architecture

### Frontend Strategy: Unified Multi-Brand Application

#### Core Components
1. **Brand Resolution Service**
   - Detects brand context from domain/subdomain
   - Provides brand configuration throughout application
   - Handles fallback scenarios

2. **Dynamic Theme System**
   - SCSS-based theming with CSS custom properties
   - Brand-specific variable files
   - Runtime theme switching capability

3. **Content Service**
   - Fetches brand-specific content from AWS
   - Implements caching strategies
   - Handles real-time updates via WebSocket/SSE

4. **Lazy-Loaded Brand Modules**
   - Brand-specific components loaded on demand
   - Shared components with brand variants
   - Optimized bundle splitting

### AWS Content Management Stack

#### Recommended Services
- **AWS AppSync:** Real-time GraphQL API for content delivery
- **Amazon S3 + CloudFront:** Media asset storage and CDN
- **AWS Amplify Studio:** Visual CMS interface for content editors
- **Amazon DynamoDB:** Content metadata and configuration storage
- **AWS Lambda:** Content processing and transformation

#### Content Types Managed
- UI themes and styling variables
- Text content (copy, labels, messages)
- Media assets (images, videos, documents)
- Component configurations
- Navigation structures

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation Setup (Weeks 1-2)
**Objectives:** Establish unified codebase and basic infrastructure

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Create unified Angular workspace with shared libraries
- [ ] Implement brand resolution service
- [ ] Set up SCSS theming architecture
- [ ] Establish AWS content infrastructure (AppSync, DynamoDB, S3)
- [ ] Create basic content service with static data

**Deliverables:**
- Unified Angular project structure
- Brand detection working on localhost
- Basic theming system operational
- AWS infrastructure provisioned

### Phase 2: Content Integration (Weeks 3-4)
**Objectives:** Integrate dynamic content management

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Build content service with real-time updates
- [ ] Implement dynamic component rendering
- [ ] Set up media asset pipeline with CloudFront
- [ ] Create Amplify Studio content models
- [ ] Develop content caching strategies

**Deliverables:**
- Working CMS integration
- Real-time content updates
- Media asset delivery system
- Content editor interface

### Phase 3: Migration & Optimization (Weeks 5-8)
**Objectives:** Migrate existing components and optimize performance

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Gradual migration of components from existing apps
- [ ] Implement lazy loading for brand-specific modules
- [ ] Set up A/B testing infrastructure
- [ ] Performance optimization and bundle analysis
- [ ] Comprehensive testing across both brands

**Deliverables:**
- Fully migrated application
- Performance benchmarks met
- A/B testing capability
- Production-ready deployment

## Technical Architecture Details

### Brand Resolution Strategy
```typescript
// Domain-based brand detection
interface BrandConfig {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  domain: string;
  theme: string;
  contentNamespace: string;
}
```

### Theming Architecture
```scss
// Brand-specific SCSS variables
:root {
  --brand-primary-color: #{$brand-primary};
  --brand-secondary-color: #{$brand-secondary};
  --brand-font-family: #{$brand-font};
}
```

### Content Service Pattern
```typescript
// Real-time content updates
interface ContentService {
  getContent(brandId: string, contentType: string): Observable<Content>;
  subscribeToUpdates(brandId: string): Observable<ContentUpdate>;
}
```

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Component Incompatibility:** Gradual migration with feature flags
- **Performance Degradation:** Bundle analysis and lazy loading
- **Content Delivery Latency:** CDN optimization and caching

### Business Risks
- **Brand Experience Consistency:** Comprehensive testing framework
- **Content Management Complexity:** User-friendly CMS interface
- **Deployment Disruption:** Blue-green deployment strategy

## Success Metrics

### Performance Targets
- Page load time: < 1 second
- First Contentful Paint: < 800ms
- Bundle size reduction: 20% compared to combined current apps

### Business Metrics
- Content update frequency: Weekly updates achievable
- Developer productivity: 30% reduction in duplicate code maintenance
- Deployment efficiency: Single pipeline for both brands

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions Required
1. **Codebase Analysis:** Review both existing applications
   - Folder structures and component hierarchies
   - Shared libraries and dependencies
   - Routing patterns and navigation structures

2. **Infrastructure Planning:** 
   - AWS account setup and permissions
   - CI/CD pipeline modifications for unified deployment
   - Domain and DNS configuration strategy

3. **Team Alignment:**
   - Stakeholder review of architecture decisions
   - Development team capacity planning
   - Content team training on new CMS

### Questions for Next Session
- What are the current folder structures of both applications?
- What shared libraries currently exist between the apps?
- How different are the routing and navigation patterns?
- What are the specific brand differences in UI/UX?
